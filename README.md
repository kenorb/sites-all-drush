sites-all-drush
===============

Example drush configuration files. Modify as desired.

You can copy these files to any of the following:

1. Drupal's /drush or sites/all/drush folder (note: sql-sync validation won't work here).
2. A .drush folder in your HOME folder.
3. Anywhere in a folder tree below an active module on your site.
4. /usr/share/drush/commands (configurable).
5. In an arbitrary folder specified with the --include option.
